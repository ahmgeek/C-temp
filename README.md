C-temp
======

This repo contains  all of my trivia C code from <code>***C Primer Plus***</code> book.</br>
It will also be updated regularly to includes  my ***C*** code exercises.</br>
I don't guarantee that my code will run on your fuckin machine, I also don't guarantee that it will have a shiny nice look as I wrote it for learning purpose.
> so please take it easy and use it on your own.
