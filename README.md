C-temp
======

This repo contains  all of my trivia **C** code from `C Primer Plus` book. And, `Learn
code the hard way book`.

It will also be updated regularly to include my general ***C*** code exercises.<br>
I don't **guarantee** that my code will run on your fuckin **machine**, I also don't **guarantee** that it will have a shiny nice look as I wrote it for learning purpose.

So please:
  > take it easy and use it on your own.
